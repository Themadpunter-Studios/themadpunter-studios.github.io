<h1>September Update</h1>
<p>
    Hello to all three of my fans! I'm still alive, but school has started, and I haven't had too much time to work on any of my projects recently.
    But, I'll tell you some of the things I've been working on so you can be assured I'm not completely slackin off.
</p>
<h2>Super Benji Worlds</h2>
<p>
    Super Benji Worlds is still in development, and I've been working on it when I have time. So far, the game is mostly complete up to the first boss,
    Tempter in the Prison House. We're currently not sure what will probably happen next, but my idea is to make a powerup that the Tempter drops. Maybe
    it could give you a higher jump or something. We'll see. The first trailer already released, but some things have changed since then - notably the entire
    design of the Prison House. It looks a lot better now, and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. For more information about Super Benji Worlds, check out the
    Super Benji X account: <a href="https://twitter.com/SuperBenjiShow">@SuperBenjiShow</a>.

<h2>Kaizo Trimps</h2>
<p>
    This one is one of the "fun projects" I've been working on. It's a spin-off of the original Trimps game, but with a much higher difficulty level and more
    active gameplay. I'm working on it in my free time at school, and it's coming along well. The game is still in the early stages of development, with content
    only up to Zone 20 and the Dimension of Anger. The mod is out, but a full playthrough is not recommended yet. For more information, go to the GitHub repo 
    <a href="https://github.com/puntgames/kaizo-trimps">here</a>.
</p>
<h2>School</h2>
<p>
    It's going well. No further information needed.
</p>
<h2>YouTube</h2>
<p>
    Mostly transitioned to Appel videos at this point because it's what my viewers enjoy.
