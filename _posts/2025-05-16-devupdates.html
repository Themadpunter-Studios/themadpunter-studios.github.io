<h1>Development Updates</h1>
<p>
  I've been pretty busy from developing games lately, and don't really have too many projects I'm working on at the moment - too busy drinking water, I guess. I'm thinking of making a new cool bullet hell type game, but I might just make it into a cool Undertale fangame instead because I don't feel like making original art, I just want to make difficult bullet patterns.
</p>
<h3>Undertale Fangame/Bullet Hell</h3>
<p>
  My main idea right now is to make a game that takes up the entire stage, and use the Yellow Soul to make it point towards an enemy and shoot it - making it more lke the Touhou-style bullet hell games. Keep an eye out for that, I might make it.
</p>
<h3>Super Benji Content</h3>
<p>
  Probably none for the time being. Neither me or triangle5820 feel like continuing our mini-series. More content WILL come eventually, I guarantee you that. Maybe I'll write another book, this one being fiction and actually published. Another opportunity to enhance the lore would be great.
</p>
<h3>Games I've Been Playing</h3>
<p>
  Probably past the Balatro phase at this point. I'm mostly playing Counter-Strike (for a class assignment, trust me on this one), and Quake 3 Arena. Again, I've been spending more time doing stuff other than games and design - good for me, bad for my fan(s?).
